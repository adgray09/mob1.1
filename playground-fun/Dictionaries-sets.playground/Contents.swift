// Dictionaries Practice

// Code the following challenges in a Swift Playground.

// 1. Create an array where the key is the name of an app and the value is the time you spend on it daily. Enter a few examples.

var appToTime: [String:Int] = [
    "Instagram" : 30,
    "Twitter" : 0,
    "Linkedin" : 60,
    "Youtube" : 60
]

print(appToTime)

// 2. Give the following dictionary. Access a hex value of a color.


var colorHex: [String:String] = [
    "purple" : "#6C3483",
    "blue" : "#2874A6",
    "green": "#1E8449" ,
    "orange" : "#D35400",
    "yellow" : "#F1C40F",
    "white" : "#FFFFFF",
    "black" : "#000000"
]

print(colorHex["purple"]!)

// Try to access the value in a safe way. ðŸ˜…

// 3. Try adding a new color `red` with hex #f20707. Then print the dictionary to see the change.

colorHex["red"] = "$f20707"

print(colorHex)

// 4. Delete any color from the dictionary. Then print the dictionary to see the change.

colorHex.removeValue(forKey: "orange")

print(colorHex)
